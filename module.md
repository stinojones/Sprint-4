# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name:

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)?
4

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:


|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |      x        |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

Unique Requirements & Stretch Challenges
Write a simple game using any game framework such as PyGame, Arcade (Python), Unity, or GoDot. You can also create your own by using graphics packages like OpenGL or Raylib.

The game must have the following characteristics:

The game must display graphics

The game must take user input from the keyboard or mouse

The game must have moveable objects

Stretch Challenges (select one):

Allow the user to save and load the game.

Add music or sound effects to the game.

Provide levels in your game that change the difficulty of the game.



### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

Youtube, chatgpt, teamai

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

tutorials from youtube, writing down comments in different sections to fully understand the code I'm writing. 

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

I want a pygame that is a 2d game somewhat like one of the gameboy zelda games.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

I want to put in at least 2 hours every school day and have the weekeneds off. I work at home or in the library.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

Building a game can be fun at the start with the idea but I think it can get hard and discouraging later on. I think energy drinks will help me stay focused and motivated as my reward. 


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
|  June 11 |   8pm    |   IM   |    setting up pygame pip and python        |   1.5 hours |
|  June 12 |   7pm    |   IM   |    starting the tutorial , setup done      |   2 hours   |
|  June 13 |   7pm    |   IM   |    got player movement and some collisions |   4.5 hours |
|  June 11 |   2pm    |   TP   |    some css animation and worked gloom shop|   2 hours   |
|  June 14 |   4pm    |   IM   |    finished most of the work for the pygame|   2 hours   |
|          |          |        |                                            |             |


## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: 
        https://github.com/stinojones/Sprint-4

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:
        https://youtu.be/tAw2T99TjpM

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.
        
|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |   yes  |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|   yes  |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |   yes  |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |   yes  |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |   yes  |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
No, I stuck with the pygame and it was fun!
6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|      10 hours     |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
Behavorial, I enjoyed making the pygame which helped me spend more time on it. Technical, I enjoyed looking over the tutorials and they were well made for learning pygame. Some ways I could improve, learn more about boundaries and I also am glad I commented on all my code so I could understand it more.
